## AstroRails

Hello, Welcome to AstroRails, a web app with the intention of cataloguing all the astrological finds that we mere humans stumble upon in the universe. Add your new found discoveries of galaxies, systems and planets to our database with the hope of increasing the shared knowledge among us.

## Tech

This app makes use of the Ruby on Rails 5.2, which uses Ruby 2.3.

## Config

To configure this app run:

Install dependencies.
`bundle install`


Migrate the database.
`rails db:migrate`


Start the secure server (running bundle exec to force the right dependency versions)
`bundle exec thin start â€”ssl`

## Process

Create a new repository on GitHub for your Rails application.
When you create the Rails app for your assessment, add the spec.md file from this repo to the root directory of the project, commit it to Git and push it up to GitHub.

Build your application. Make sure to commit early and commit often. Commit messages should be meaningful (clearly describe what you're doing in the commit) and accurate (there should be nothing in the commit that doesn't match the description in the commit message). Good rule of thumb is to commit every 3-7 mins of actual coding time. Most of your commits should have under 15 lines of code and a 2 line commit is perfectly acceptable. This is important and you'll be graded on this.

Record at least a 30 min coding session. During the session, either think out loud or not. It's up to you. You don't need to submit it, but we may ask for it at a later time.

Make sure to check each box in your spec.md (replace the space between the square braces with an x) and explain next to each one how you've met the requirement before you submit your project.

Write a README.md.

Fill out this checklist.

Submit a video of how a user would interact with your working web application.

Write a blog post about the project and process.

When done, submit your GitHub repo's url, a link to your video demo, and a link to your blog post in the corresponding text boxes in the right rail. Hit "I'm done" to wrap it up.
